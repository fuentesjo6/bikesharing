# CitiBike Data Visualization ðŸš´

Utilizing data provided by CitiBike [link] for and Tableu I created a Viz for checkout times for users. Utiliziing Tableu and filtering the data I was able to create a visual to show the checkout times for all users with a filter on the right right side that allows the user to select filters.

Utlizing the same data I created a visual for checkout times by gender allowing us to select the Gender and the trip duration in minutes
