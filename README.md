# CitiBike Data Visualization ðŸš´

- Utilizing data provided by CitiBike for and Tableu I created a Viz for checkout times for users. Utiliziing Tableu and filtering the data I was able to create a visual to show the checkout times for all users with a filter on the right right side that allows the user to select filters. Before being able to do this we needed to convert values with the data to allow us to use them in Tabluew. The original data showed "tripduration" in seconds and they neede to be converted into a 'timestamp". 

### DataFrame without the 'tripduration' converted

### DataFrame with 'tripduration' converted to "timestamp'

- Utlizing the same data and filtering using Tablue I created a visualization of "User Trips by Gender". This visual shows a heat mat of "Customer" and "Subscribers", we can then see that male subscribers tend to utilze the bicycles more than female subscribers do. The visual also allows you to see that what days of the week have the heaviest usgae of bikes.
